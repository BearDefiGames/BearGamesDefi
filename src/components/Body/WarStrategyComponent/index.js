                      The pirates launch four ships to loot tourist yachts of their GOLD tokens treasures
                      in the four field bays; these activities go relatively hindered due to the seaâ€™s sheer
                      size. However, the BEAR Navy has enough PAW Operative ships to prevent pirate ships from
                      returning to land; instead, the BEAR NAVY forces them through a narrow path, where
                      explosive underwater mines lay await.

                      bay has an equal chance of being sunken and is eligible for the BEAR NAVY injury insurance
                      for its registered field bay. 1/4 of BNB entering each of the four field bay in 24 hours
                      goes to the Injury Insurance Pool (displayed as a wound lottery jackpot on the wounded PAW
                      Operative ship card) and is paid to the injured PAW Operative for that field bay. 3/4 of
                      BNB entering each of the four field bay goes to the Divs Payout Pool (see Mission Economics).

                      Meanwhile, the other unwounded PAW Operative ships continue with GOLD tokens salvaging
                      (recovering) from the Pirate ships. As the unwounded PAW Operative ships in each of the
                      four field bay make progress, they release GOLD tokens to all Open Chest on those Regular
                      PAW CARDS associated with their field bay only. The salvaging process occurs continuously
                      over time, and the salvaged GOLD tokens are issued at the rate of 125% of the BNB used to
                      purchase respective Open CHEST (GOLD tokens Bond) on the Regular PAW CARDS. Understandably,
                      the time it takes to recover each full chest of GOLD tokens varies.
