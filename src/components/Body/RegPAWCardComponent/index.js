                  Each Regular PAW CARD displays a Bear Navy PAW Operative Ship with a unique character
                  set and can only move into one of the four field bays. The Regular PAW CARD is used to
                  record the number of Open Chests obtained when the card moves into the Regular PAW CARD
                  associated field bay as a CHEST list on the CARD.

                  The salvaged GOLD tokens received by
                  each Regular PAW CARDâ€™s Open Chest are claimable by clicking the withdraw button in front
                  of the Open Chest. The withdrawal automatically closes the Chest and makes it ineligible
                  to salvaged GOLD tokens from its registered field bay.  Veterans (Regular PAW CARD holders)
                  are advised to wait till their Open CHEST receives its complete eligible salvaged GOLD tokens
                  (then Chest becomes Closed) before withdrawing their GOLD tokens.
